Exception Explorer
------------------

Performs static code analysis on .NET assemblies to identify unhandled exceptions, whether or not they are documented.

The analysis is performed on the IL code extracted from the assembly, so third-party libraries (and the .NET Framework itself) can still be analysed - the source code is not required. If the XML documentation for the assembly is available, then this can also be consulted.
